Feature: AbilityToVoteForNextCompetition

This is me demonstrating BDD Testing, This feature is yet to be built and this test is pretty bad but it will get better
As a user, I want to vote for the next competition's game after a competition ends, so that I can continuously engage in challenges with my friends.

I was unable to finish up the full testing of this feature as I ran out of time but i was fairly close to finishing it up. I will continue to work on it and finish it up in the future.
